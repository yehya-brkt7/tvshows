The project utilizes responsive UI components built with React, HTML, CSS modules, and MUI (Material-UI). 

Features
Responsive UI Components: The project implements responsive UI components using React, HTML, CSS modules, and MUI. This ensures that the website is visually appealing and provides a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

REST API Integration: REST APIs are created and integrated into the project to generate visually appealing card lists. These card lists contain information about each TV show, including a search bar for show search functionality. Users can easily search for TV shows and view relevant information.

Performance Optimization: The project focuses on optimizing website performance. This includes code optimization techniques, caching mechanisms, and image optimization. By minimizing loading times and improving responsiveness, users can enjoy a faster and smoother browsing experience.

Zustand State Management: The project utilizes the Zustand state management library to enhance app performance. Zustand allows for efficient state management, resulting in improved performance and better user experience.

CRUD Operations: The project implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to add, update ratings, and delete TV shows from the watched list within each card. Users can easily manage their watched list and interact with TV show ratings.

Share List Page: A Share List page is developed for each unique user. It generates a unique URL using React Hooks such as useParams and useLocation. Users can share their personalized TV show lists with others by sharing the unique URL.

Performance and Security Measures: The project incorporates performance and security measures to provide a better user experience. This includes implementing techniques for code optimization, caching, and applying security measures such as input validation and protection against common vulnerabilities.
